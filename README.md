# Project Overview
The **Flash Quiz App** is a mobile application designed specifically for assignment 2 in the IMAD subject.
The application was developed using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**.
The applications main purpose is to test the knowledge of a user and how well they know their history. 
The app shows five questions that are all based on the history of South Africa and past generations. All of the questions are based off of true and false and is easy for the user to access.
The **Flash Quiz App** is an easy and effective application with a simple interface and clear instructions making it easy to understand the application.
This app was created to ensure that it meets the required standard for the assignment, ensuring that it is a functional and well-formed app.

 # 3. App purpose and features
# Purpose:
The purpose of The **Flash Quiz App** is to make users aware of how much knowledge they have on the history of the world helping them identify how they can improve 
Enables the user to learn new things about certain questions that they may have not known the answer to.
The user may also make the quiz fun and test their friends and family on the flash cards as well.
The user is then able to see their score of how well they did on the quiz in the end and will be able to see which questions they may have answered wrong.

# Key features:
1. User Interface was made creatively with a straightforward input system that gives users a easy way to answer all the questions
2. The questions are fairly easy and are true and false only, making it easy for the user to answer the questions
3. The app gives the user a proper overview of the questions that the user answered correctly and the questions they can improve on.

These features are key because they provide an uncomplicated applicati9on making it convenient for all users to use.

 # 4. Design considerations:
The design on **Flash Card Quiz** was influenced by the key design features:
1. **User interface**- which was designed to ensure the application is easy and efficient for users to use ensuring a manageable occurence
   
2. **App Responsiveness**- the response time of the app is rapid ensuring that it does not take up much of the users time or the battery life.
 
3. **Simplicity**- the application is simple and effortless to ensure that it is compatible for all users to understand what is happening in the app.

 ## 6. Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

**Challenge 1**: My application was having a problem running.
**Solution**: With going through my code again, i realised that i made a couple minor errors that i could quickly fix.

**Challenge 2**: I was having trouble perfecting my array statements in order for it to make sense.
**Solution**: With the assistance of AI, i was shown some tips and proper methods of making a proper array and ensuring that it functions fully

From these challenges, i fully learnt how to properly run my app and how to comfortable make array statements.

## 7. Future enhancements
Even though the current app provides the user with the key goal, there are many features that could be added to improve the application for the future.

**Feature 1:**:Allow the questions to change order once the user restarts the quiz.
**Feature 2:** Allowing users to restart with a new set of questions and not it only being the same five
**Feature 3:** Allowing users to be able to use dark mode to save batter usage.

These would improve the level of usability for the application in the future.
